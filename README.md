# StudyMates
StudyMates is a desktop application designed to establish academic collaboration among students. 
Its goal is to connect users based on their learning needs and areas of expertise. 

Features that is provided by the application:

1-When a user registers on the application, a confirmation email is sent to verify their registration(they can only capture an email and username which is not captured already).

2-Users can search for other users by their usernames. They can also filter users based on the courses they are interested in, their location, and their ranking.

3-Users can register for specific courses. Registering for a course means they will appear in the course table, indicating they are available to collaborate with others.

4-They can send requests to other users to invite them to study together for a specific course.

5-Users can view both their sent and received requests. They can cancel a sent request if they change their mind, and they can accept or reject incoming requests.

6-If a user accepts another user’s request, they automatically become StudyMates within the app.

7-StudyMates can chat with each other in real time. After their study sessions, they can rate each other and leave or update comments.

8-Users can view other users’ profiles, including their StudyMates, the courses they are working on, rankings, and received comments. They can search for a specific user or course through other users' profiles.

9-Users can edit their personal information, including their "About Me" section, profile picture, email, username, name, surname, location, and password.

The application utilizes JavaFX for building a responsive and interactive user interface, providing users with a smooth and visually appealing experience. For data storage and real-time synchronization, the platform integrates with Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL database. This allows the application to efficiently manage user data, course registrations, chat messages, and other dynamic content.
